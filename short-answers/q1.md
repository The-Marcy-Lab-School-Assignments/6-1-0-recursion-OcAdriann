# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function thats use to keep invoking the function within the function as if it was looping. The "cases" that are needed for a recursive function is the base case that ends the recursion and a recursive case that makes the recursion happen.
