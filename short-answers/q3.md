# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Writing a function recursively gives us more elegant and concise code thats more readable, simplifies complex problems and breaks it down into sub problems, best used on data types like linked list, graphs, and trees. However it does take up more space on the call stack and is less efficient. Could also risk a potential stack overflow if not done properly and recursive solutions can be confusing.
